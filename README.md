## Monte Carlo Simulation of Particle Distribution in Potential Wells with Thermal Reservoir

Our study focuses on the adaptation of a Monte Carlo-based simulation for obtaining the energy distribution of particles within an array of potential wells in contact with a thermal reservoir. 
The main objective of this project is to investigate the efficiency of the simulation when executed using both single-processor serial and parallel processing via SSH cluster connection. By dividing the algorithm into parallelized tasks, we explore the benefits of parallel computing, focusing on computational time and resource utilization.  The final results use simultaneous runs to display average energy behavior according to temperature increase, the same as the system's heat capacity.

Traditionally, programming favored serial computation, where problems are tackled sequentially on a single processor. However, with growing computing demands, parallel computing has become crucial. Parallel computing utilizes multiple processors to solve problems concurrently, dividing tasks into manageable parts executed simultaneously. This approach enhances performance and reduces execution time for large-scale computations. Effective coordination mechanisms ensure seamless collaboration among processors, optimizing overall efficiency.
